## Current Status
- ✅ Changes committed
- ✅ Old remote removed

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Create New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `hotel-resort-management` (or any name you prefer)
3. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
4. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
5. Click "Create repository"
6. Copy the repository URL (it will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hotel-resort-management.git`)

### Option 2: Use Existing Repository
If you already have a repository, just provide the URL.

## After You Have the URL

Run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME):

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Or tell me your repository URL and I'll set it up for you!
